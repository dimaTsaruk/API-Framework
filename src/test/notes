Json arrays needs to be deserialized into array of objects
Json Object needs to be deserialized into objects


/**
 * The objectMapper doesn't have a build in function to convert Json array to List of objects.
 * We can convert a Json array into the Java array of objects. In this case, we're converting the body which
 * is a Json array, we're converting it to the array of RebrandlyLink[].
 * And then we convert regular array to List using Arrays.asList(...) method.
 *
 * If we want to convert the Json Obj into the Java obj, we dont need to put [] after Rebr.Link.Resp.
 * But if we want to convert the Json array into the Java array, we need to put [], bc that's how you define
 * the array.
 *
 * In the next line we simply convert Json array into Java array. And then we convert this array into the List
 * of objects.

 List<RebrandlyLink> linksList =
                 Arrays.asList(objectMapper.readValue(response.body().asString(), RebrandlyLink[].class));
         MatcherAssert.assertThat(linksList.size(), Matchers.is(1));

 ! Each scenario should run independent and clean up after.

 Topic: Dependency injection
 Concept of DI : we have one class1 that will store common data. (ex.Response). And in another class we inject our
 class1 - simply declare variable of this class on class level. We also need to import <dep.> called
 "cucumber-picocontainer" which will internally inject everything for us.
 So the whole DI meaning : you basically providing objects to the class where you wanna use it.
 When we use pccntr its a mandatory to use constructor.

// convert from Data table into object

@When("^I Enter My Regular Expenses$")
public void I_Enter_My_Regular_Expenses(DataTable dataTable) throws Throwable {
  List<Expense> expenseList = dataTable.asList(Expense.class);

  for (Expense expense : expenseList) {
    System.out.println(expense);
  }

  // Here, asList() creates a List of Expense objects.
